# Deepening

How to deepen a cluster of shallow modules safely, given its dependencies. This guide uses **module**, **interface**, **seam**, and **adapter** as [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) defines them.

## Dependency categories

When assessing a candidate for deepening, classify its dependencies. The category determines how tests exercise the deepened module across its seam.

### 1. In-process

Pure computation, in-memory state, no I/O. Always deepenable. Merge the modules and test through the new interface directly. No adapter needed.

### 2. Local-substitutable

Dependencies that have local test stand-ins (PGLite for Postgres, in-memory filesystem). Deepenable if the stand-in exists. Tests run the deepened module with the stand-in. The seam is internal; no port belongs at the module's external interface.

### 3. Remote but owned (ports and adapters)

Your own services across a network boundary (microservices, internal APIs). Define a **port** (interface) at the seam. The deep module owns the logic and receives the transport as an **adapter**. Tests use an in-memory adapter. Production uses an HTTP, gRPC, or queue adapter.

Recommendation shape: *"Define a port at the seam, implement an HTTP adapter for production and an in-memory adapter for testing, so the logic sits in one deep module even though it's deployed across a network."*

### 4. True external (mock)

Third-party services you do not control, such as Stripe or Twilio. The deepened module takes the external dependency as an injected port; tests provide a mock adapter.

## Seam discipline

- **One adapter means a hypothetical seam. Two adapters means a real one.** Don't introduce a port unless at least two adapters are justified (typically production + test). A single-adapter seam is just indirection.
- **Internal seams vs external seams.** A deep module can have internal seams (private to its implementation, used by its own tests) as well as the external seam at its interface. Don't expose internal seams through the interface just because tests use them.

## Testing strategy: replace, don't layer

- Old unit tests on shallow modules become waste once tests at the deepened module's interface exist. Delete them.
- Write new tests at the deepened module's interface. The **interface is the test surface**.
- Tests assert on observable outcomes through the interface, not internal state.
- Tests should survive internal refactors. They describe behaviour, not implementation. If a test has to change when the implementation changes, it's testing past the interface.
