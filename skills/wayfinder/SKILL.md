description: Map work that exceeds one agent session as decision tickets. Use only when the user asks to create or continue a wayfinder map.

A loose idea has arrived — too big for one agent session and wrapped in fog: the way from here to the **destination** isn't visible yet. Wayfinding is about finding that way, not charging at the destination. This skill charts the way as a **shared map** in local Markdown files, then works its **decision tickets** — questions whose resolution is a decision, not slices of a build to execute — one at a time until the route is clear.

**Write all prose in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English** — the map body, ticket questions, resolution comments, the Decisions-so-far gists, and your messages to the user. **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `domain-modeling`. Name it in the brief of every research subagent you fire.

The destination varies per effort, and naming it is the first act of charting — it shapes every ticket. It might be a spec to hand off and iterate on, a decision to lock before planning starts, or a change made in place like a data-structure migration. The map is domain-agnostic — engineering work, course content, whatever fits the shape.

## Local-only boundary

Wayfinder never publishes tickets to the issue tracker.

Wayfinder never creates, edits, assigns, comments on, or closes issue-tracker tickets.

Wayfinder stores each map at `.scratch/wayfinder/<effort>/map.md`.

Wayfinder stores each ticket at `.scratch/wayfinder/<effort>/tickets/NN-<slug>.md`.

The effort directory contains the complete map and ticket set. Delete that directory to remove the effort.

Use `to-spec` to publish a spec to the issue tracker.

Use `to-tickets` to publish implementation tickets to the issue tracker.

If another setup document describes tracker operations for Wayfinder, this local-only boundary takes precedence.

## Plan, don't do

Wayfinder is **planning** by default: each ticket resolves a decision, and the map is done when the way is clear — nothing left to decide before someone goes and does the thing. The pull to just do the work is usually the signal you've reached the edge of the map and it's time to hand off. An effort can override this in its **Notes** — carrying execution into the map itself — but absent that, produce decisions, not deliverables.

## Refer by name

Every map and ticket has a **name** — its title. In everything the human reads — narration, the map's Decisions-so-far — refer to it by that name, never by a bare number or slug. A list of bare numbers is hard to read. Use the file path as the link target when a link is useful.

## The Map

The map is the file `.scratch/wayfinder/<effort>/map.md` — the canonical artifact. Its tickets are child files in `.scratch/wayfinder/<effort>/tickets/`.

The map is an **index**, not a store. It lists the decisions made and points at the tickets that hold their detail; a decision lives in exactly one place — its ticket — so the map never restates it, only gists it and links.

**The map, its child tickets, blocking, and frontier queries all live in local files.** Read `skills/setup/wayfinder-operations.md` for the file format.

### The map body

The whole map loads at low resolution once per session. Open tickets are **not** listed. Find them by scanning the effort's `tickets/` directory.

```markdown
## Destination

<what reaching the end of this map looks like — the spec, decision, or change this effort is finding its way to. One or two lines; every session orients to it before choosing a ticket.>

## Notes

<domain; skills every session should consult; standing preferences for this effort>

## Decisions so far

<!-- the index — one line per closed ticket: enough to judge relevance, then zoom the link for the detail the ticket holds -->

- [<closed ticket title>](link) — <one-line gist of the answer>

## Not yet specified

<!-- see "Fog of war": in-scope fog you can't ticket yet; graduates as the frontier advances -->

## Out of scope

<!-- see "Out of scope": work ruled beyond the destination; closed, never graduates -->
```

### Tickets

Each ticket is a **child file** of the map. Its file name is its identity. Its body is the question, sized to one 100K token agent session:

```markdown
#<NN> — <ticket title>

Type: <research|prototype|planning|task>
Status: open
Blocked by: None

## Question

<the decision or investigation this ticket resolves>
```

Each ticket carries a `Type:` line with one of `research`, `prototype`, `planning`, or `task` (see [Ticket Types](#ticket-types)).

A session **claims** a ticket by changing its `Status:` line to `claimed`, **first**, before any work, so concurrent sessions skip it. An open ticket with no claim is unclaimed.

Blocking uses a `Blocked by:` line that lists ticket numbers. A ticket is **unblocked** when every listed ticket has `Status: resolved`. The **frontier** is the open, unblocked, unclaimed child files — the edge of the known.

The answer isn't part of the question body — it is recorded under `## Answer` on resolution (see [Work through the map](#work-through-the-map)). Link assets from the ticket file when needed.

## Ticket Types

Every ticket is either **HITL** — human in the loop, worked *with* a human who speaks for themselves — or **AFK**, driven by the agent alone. A HITL ticket only resolves through that live exchange; the agent never stands in for the human's side of it (a planning agent that answers its own questions has broken this).

- **Research** (AFK): Reading documentation, third-party APIs, or local resources like knowledge bases to surface a fact a decision waits on. Resolved by a `research` **subagent**. Use when knowledge outside the current working directory is required.
- **Prototype** (HITL): Raise the fidelity of the discussion by making a cheap, rough, concrete artifact to react to — an outline, a rough take, a stub, or UI/logic code via the prototype skill. Links the prototype as an asset. Use when "how should it look" or "how should it behave" is the key question.
- **Planing** (HITL): Conversation via the lets-plan-code and domain-modeling skills, one question at a time. The default case.
- **Task** (HITL or AFK): Manual work that must happen before a *decision* can be made — nothing to decide, prototype, or research, but the discussion is blocked until it's done. Signing up for a service so its API can be judged, provisioning access, moving data so its shape can be seen. This is the one type that *does* rather than decides — and it earns its place by unblocking a decision, not by delivering the destination. The agent drives it alone where it can (AFK); otherwise it hands the human a precise checklist (HITL). Resolved when the work is done; the answer records what was done and any resulting facts (credentials location, new URLs, row counts) later tickets depend on.

## Fog of war

The map is _deliberately_ incomplete: don't chart what you can't yet see. Beyond the live tickets lies the **fog of war** — the dim view of decisions and investigations you can tell are coming but can't yet pin down, because they hang on questions still open. Resolving a ticket clears the fog ahead of it, graduating whatever's now specifiable into fresh tickets — one at a time, until the way to the destination is clear and no tickets remain.

The map's **Not yet specified** section is where that dim view is written down: the suspected question, the area to revisit later. It's the undiscovered frontier _toward_ the destination — everything here is in scope, just not sharp enough to ticket. Write as loosely or as fully as the view allows; it doubles as a signpost for collaborators reading where the effort is headed.

**Fog or ticket?** The test is whether you can state the question precisely now — _not_ whether you can answer it now.

- **Ticket when** the question is already sharp — even if it's blocked and you can't act on it yet.
- **Not yet specified when** you can't yet phrase it that sharply. Don't pre-slice the fog into ticket-sized pieces: it's coarser than a ticket, and one patch may graduate into several tickets, or none, once the frontier reaches it.

**Not yet specified** excludes what's already decided (Decisions so far), what's already a live ticket, and what's out of scope (the next section).

## Out of scope

Fog only ever gathers _toward_ the destination. The destination fixes the scope, so work beyond it is **out of scope** — it isn't fog, and it doesn't belong in **Not yet specified**. It gets its own **Out of scope** section on the map: work you've consciously ruled out of _this_ effort. Scope, not sharpness, lands it here.

Out-of-scope work never graduates — the frontier stops at the destination — so it returns only if the destination is redrawn, and then as a fresh effort, not a resumption.

Ruling something out of scope is a scoping act, not a step on the route. When a ticket that already exists turns out to sit past the destination — mis-scoped in while charting, or exposed by a resolution — set its `Status:` to `resolved` and leave one line in the **Out of scope** section. Include the gist and the reason. It stays out of **Decisions so far**, which records the route actually walked — a scope boundary isn't a step on it.

## Invocation

Two modes. Either way, **never resolve more than one ticket per session** — except research tickets.

### Chart the map

User invokes with a loose idea.

1. **Name the destination.** Run a `lets-plan-code` and `domain-modeling` session to pin down what this map is finding its way to — the spec, decision, or change. The destination fixes the scope, so it's settled first.
2. **Map the frontier.** Plan again, **breadth-first** this time: fan out across the whole space rather than deep on any one thread, surfacing the open decisions and the first steps takeable now. **If this surfaces no fog** — the way to the destination is already clear, the whole journey small enough for one session — you don't need a map. Stop and ask the user how they'd like to proceed.
3. **Create the map** at `.scratch/wayfinder/<effort>/map.md`: fill in Destination and Notes, leave Decisions-so-far empty, and sketch the fog in **Not yet specified**.
4. **Create the tickets you can specify now** as child files in `.scratch/wayfinder/<effort>/tickets/`. Number them in dependency order. Add each `Blocked by:` line after all ticket files exist. Everything you cannot yet specify stays in the fog — the **Not yet specified** section.
5. **Start the research subagents.** For each `research` ticket, start one subagent with the `research` skill and an isolated branch.
6. Stop — charting is one session's work; it hand-resolves nothing.

### Work through the map

User invokes with an effort name. The effort name selects the map and the next frontier ticket.

1. Load `.scratch/wayfinder/<effort>/map.md` — the low-resolution view, not every ticket body.
2. Choose the first frontier ticket in number order. Do not bypass the frontier because a ticket name or number is supplied. **Claim it** by writing `Status: claimed` before any work.
3. If no frontier ticket exists, inspect the fog and open tickets.
   - If `Not yet specified` is empty and every ticket is resolved, say exactly: `No fog remains, everything is ready.` Then stop.
   - If open tickets remain but none is in the frontier, report that the effort waits for a claim or blocker to clear, and stop.
   - If the fog contains an item that can now become a precise question, create the next ticket in the effort's `tickets/` directory, then continue with that ticket.
4. Resolve it — **zoom as needed**: read the full body of any related or resolved ticket on demand; invoke the skills the `## Notes` block names. If in doubt, use `lets-plan-code` and `domain-modeling`.
5. Record the resolution: append the answer under `## Answer`, set `Status: resolved`, and append a context pointer to the map's Decisions-so-far.
6. Add newly surfaced tickets. Graduate any fog that the answer makes specifiable, clear each graduated patch from **Not yet specified**, and store each new ticket in the effort's `tickets/` directory. If the answer reveals a ticket — this one or another — sits beyond the destination, rule it out of scope instead of resolving it on the route. If the decision invalidates other parts of the map, update those local files.

The user may run unblocked tickets in parallel, so expect other sessions to edit the effort's local files concurrently.
